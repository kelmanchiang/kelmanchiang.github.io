<h3 id="past-experiences">Past Experiences</h3>
<p>I moved to San Francisco in 2020 (right before the pandemic) and found my place at Postmates. I worked on optimizing the driver sign up funnel, reducing drop off and maximizing conversion rates. This was achieved over multiple AB tests and funnel improvements. Uber acquired Postmates in late 2020.</p>

<p>I joined Neuron Mobility shortly before their 10M Series A round, where I was the first data hire. I worked closely with engineers and product managers to setup data reporting and metrics. I implemented Tableau Server and dashboards for the entire company, advancing a data-first culture across teams.</p>

<p>The Digital Planning Lab in the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore is an outfit that uses technology and data to transform how we plan our city. I’ve gained experience in tackling urban-science challenges and approaching city planning issues  with geospatial analytics of people-centric datasets.</p>

<h3 id="geospatial--data">Geospatial &amp; Data</h3>
<p>I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Geography, specialising in GIS. I started my geospatial training with ArcGIS and understood the fundamentals of programming with C/C++. I currently code in SQL &amp; Python for my data projects and am still learning from the open source everyday.</p>
