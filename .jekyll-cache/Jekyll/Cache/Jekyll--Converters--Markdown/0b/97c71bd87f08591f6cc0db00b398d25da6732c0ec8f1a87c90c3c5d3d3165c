I"˜<h3 id="current-role">Current Role</h3>
<p>I am currently the Lead Data Analyst at Neruon Mobility, Southeast Asiaâ€™s fastest micromobility startup. Being in a very lean company that operates across 5 cities (and counting) has trained my laser focus and critical thinking to quickly deconstruct issues and tackle them head-on with data.</p>

<p>As the first data hire, my CTO threw me into the deep end of the pool right on Day 1. I oversee and manage Neuronâ€™s data reporting &amp; real time metric tracking via Tableau Dashboards, providing key actionable insights to all departments (Product, Finance, Marketing, Operations).</p>

<h3 id="past-experience">Past Experience</h3>
<p>I used to work at the Digital Planning Lab in the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore. The lab is an outfit that uses technology and data to transform how we plan our city. Iâ€™ve gained experience in tackling urban-science challenges and approaching city planning issues  with geospatial analytics of people-centric datasets.</p>

<h3 id="geospatial--data">Geospatial &amp; Data</h3>
<p>I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Geography, specialising in GIS. I started my geospatial training with ArcGIS and understood the fundamentals of programming with C/C++.</p>

<p>I currently code in SQL &amp; Python for my data projects and am still learning from the open source everyday.</p>
