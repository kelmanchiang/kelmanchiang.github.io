I"*<p>I’ve been a Data Analytics Mentor on Sprinboard for awhile now, and when students finish the curriculum, they seem to wonder what’s next for them. After all, they’ve been through a rigorous bootcamp that has equipped them with the core skills of being a Data Analyst. As the name of the program suggests, there is much more to learn and the bootcamp is just a stepping stone. For my past, present &amp; future students, here’s a list of resources that I’ve compiled which would be useful for the continued learning in the field of data.</p>
