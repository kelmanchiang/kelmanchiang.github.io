This website documents some of my work and hopefully it helps others who may have encountered the same challenges as me.

### Experience
 I currently work at the Digital Planning Lab in the Urban Redevelopment Authority. The lab is an outfit that uses technology and data to transform how we plan our city. My current job puts me on the forefront of urban-science challenges, tackling planning questions with geospatial analytics of people-centric datasets. I enjoy delving into the data, inquiring on how actionable insights can be gleaned to plan and develop my city better.

### Geospatial & Data
I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Geography, specialising in GIS. I started my geospatial training with ArcGIS and understood the fundamentals of programming with C/C++. I currently code in Python for my data analysis projects and am still learning from the open source everyday.
