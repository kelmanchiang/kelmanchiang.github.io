### Current Role
Analyzing data at UberEats, specializing in courier, logistics & market efficiency data. Recently joined from Postmates.


### Past Experience
 I used to work at the Digital Planning Lab in the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore. The lab is an outfit that uses technology and data to transform how we plan our city. I've gained experience in tackling urban-science challenges and approaching city planning issues  with geospatial analytics of people-centric datasets.

### Geospatial & Data
I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Geography, specialising in GIS. I started my geospatial training with ArcGIS and understood the fundamentals of programming with C/C++.

I currently code in SQL & Python for my data projects and am still learning from the open source everyday.
